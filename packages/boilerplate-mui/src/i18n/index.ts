Take the snake and take the fog, and finally it is soil.
The old man is screaming, and he is aiming for a thousand miles.
The martyrs are young and strong.
The period of profit and loss is not only in the sky.
The blessing of the good fortune can be won forever.
Fortunately, even swearing, the song is ambiguous.`,

腾蛇乘雾，终为土灰。
老骥伏枥，志在千里。

盈缩之期，不但在天。
养怡之福，可得永年。
幸甚至哉，歌以咏志。`,
